# Tamagotchi feature on website

## The purpose of this project is to build a Tamagotchi  that will keep users engaged for longer on the website

## Brief

To build an animated Tamagotchi that can be named, selected, fed, hugged, made to dance, drink, sleep and ask questions, the following technical brief can be followed:

Choose a programming language and platform: You will be building this project in React. Additionally, you will need to decide whether to build the game for desktop, mobile, or web platforms.

Create a user interface: The next step is to create a user interface for the game. This will involve designing the game screen, the Tamagotchi character, and the various buttons and controls for feeding, hugging, dancing, drinking, sleeping, and asking questions.

Implement the game logic: The game logic will determine how the Tamagotchi responds to various actions, such as feeding or hugging. For example, if the Tamagotchi is hungry, feeding it will increase its energy level. If the Tamagotchi is tired, putting it to sleep will increase its energy level.

Add animations and sound effects: To make the game more engaging and entertaining, you can add animations and sound effects to the Tamagotchi's movements and actions. For example, when the Tamagotchi dances, it could play a fun music track and move in sync with the beat.

Implement character selection and naming: To allow players to select a character and give it a name, you can add a character selection screen and a name input screen. The player can choose from different Tamagotchi characters and enter a name of their choice.

Test and debug: Once the game has been developed, it's important to thoroughly test it to ensure that all features are working correctly and there are no bugs or glitches. You can also gather feedback from players to make improvements or add new features.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
